whether I think the world is worth
saving. I think the world is first
worth loving.  For it is just a marble
of the human heart. Turn it and behold
all its contradictions. Sometimes it is azure sapphire,
sometimes it’s downright gangrenous. Singular, always,
this tiny gem of life in a fist of dark,
the earth and the human heart.

People ask me why
believe in God?
Why have faith at all? Why not just do
good deeds? Faith is the pillow
on which all of my good deeds sleep—
And whose true religion is not                     an attempt
to recover the Beloved
to their bed?

So when I say Amen,
when I say,  “The dawn is breaking the bones of your heart like twigs,”
look at every fall we’ve taken, and remember we are still august.
Consider the tiniest sparrow:
its belief in its seeming invincibility.
Its ringing throat.
Its eggshell bones.  A body so feeble
all it has is song.    Well, there may be no
gorgeous harmony for us at the end of the day
but predators I pray, won’t you feast on this praise?

What I mean is,
                         Creation will kill you
                         it is so beautiful. Look at how brightly
it unmakes
all its children.

So when I say humanity is my first love,
I mean 276 girls studying physics,
80,000 Palestinians and a black boy.

When I say burial, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I mean I also saw life today. It fasted
from sun up to sundown and broke
with much joy, and there is no shroud
white enough to smother the muzzle
of spring, its fatness, its pink.

So when I say feast,
I mean quince, parabolic
pear, or peach
or perhaps
my tongue,
or lower,
my breasts,
or lower,
my
flesh like a claret ribbon in your mouth
because it’s all love &           it tastes good
to me, it tastes
good to me it
tastes good to me.                 When the fruit in your hand becomes red meat,
what do you need to know
about the sine or the cosine, except
the apple curves to fit
the vivid frame of your lips.
And that’s another amen.



When I say Let's stay
marooned in this here chapel
of a few hours, remember how we
have all kissed someone in the scratched-out
light. They became a fountain,
and our mouths were full
of pennies after.

When I say hell,
I mean                          He’ll heal.
Look around you at this forgiving miracle:
to burn one day and not burn out.



When I say alleged heaven, remember
the crime they have tried to make of our living.
Remember the body
has so many things to apologize for
for which it is not sorry. I am not

sorry
for bearing witness.
For loving what I could not
love, for living in the creases
of your palms like salt. I am your excess
tears and I am not sorry. I am
not sorry for turning this into a lament
or for using familiar words to comfort you,
for taking up language as the prosthetic.
A prayer for a phantom limb so that I can hold this world
with extra hands. That’s how much I want
to keep it.
How much
I want to keep you safe.""")
